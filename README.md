# MetaF
> **MetaF**ramework for front-end.

> **WARNING:** it's early beta, so documentation may have mistakes, if you face any problems feel free to create [issues](https://github.com/Igmat/metaf/issues).

Since `MetaF` itself isn't working yet, most probably you were looking for one of those:  
1. [metaf-resolvable](./packages/resolvable) - abstract resolvable mixin and injection root for adding DI/IoC to any framework
2. [metaf-react](./packages/react) - resolvable component and injection root for adding DI/IoC to [React](https://reactjs.org/) App
